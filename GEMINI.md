# nocodo - Qwen Code Context

## Project Overview
nocodo is a local AI-assisted development environment that provides guardrails and good software engineering practices for code generation. It runs entirely on Linux machines without cloud dependencies.

## Development Workflow

* Create a new branch for each task
* Branch names should start with `feature/`, `chore/`, or `fix/`
* Add tests for any new features added, particularly integration or end-to-end tests
* Run formatters, linters, and tests before committing changes
* When finished, please commit and push to the new branch
* Please mention the GitHub issue if provided
* Commit small chunks
* Selectively add files to git; maintain `.gitignore`
* If working on a GitHub issue: create a PR, update the task in the end
* If working on a GitHub issue: do not close the issue until I manually test
